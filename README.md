# Pico_SmartBarrier

## Summary 

It's a Bachelor Course Projectâ€”a small prototype with Raspberry Pi Pico aiming to make barriers smart. The goal is to reduce traffic congestion when necessary and utilize space more efficiently.
(I recommend using a microcontroller with 4 Adc pinouts.It may be other Raspery Pi models or other ESP32 models maybe)

#### It has 2 Main Parts :
* Web
  *  MQTT Cloud (AdaFruit)
  *  Flask Framework
* Robot
  * Hardware
  * Mechanical
  * Software



## -> Web:
* MQTT Cloud(AdaFruit)
  * Sign- up from https://io.adafruit.com/
  * Create a new Feed
* Flask FrameWork
  *  cd Flask
  *  python AdaFruit.py

## -> Robot
* Hardware
  * 1 Raspberry Pi Pico
  * 1 L298N
  * 2 DC Motors
  * 4 LDR sensors (I used 3 because Pico has 3 ADC pin to Read)
  * 1 Solar Panel (10x20 cm)
  * 1 Voltage Control USB Regulator:
  * 2 (3.7 V) Batteries
  * 1 LM 7805
  * 1 Copper Plate (Optional)
  
* Mechanical
  * 3D Printer https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hb0MZrVrAALZshriPRli9M9IU6Oxqj3v?usp=sharing

* Software
  * Upload MixAllPico.py to Raspberry Pi Pico and rename it main.py using Thonny IDE -> https://thonny.org/
